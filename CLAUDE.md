## Development Guidelines

### Prototyping Philosophy
- **Frontend-Only**: No backend integration required
- **Production Feel**: Code quality that feels like production
- **Rapid Iteration**: Easy to modify branding, copy, and layouts
- **Stakeholder Ready**: Polished enough for client presentations

### Component Architecture
- **Standalone Components**: All components use standalone: true for modularity
- **Self-Contained Features**: Each feature is designed to be as standalone as possible to facilitate easy adoption and integration into the production site
- **Reactive Patterns**: RxJS for state management
- **TypeScript Strict**: Full type safety enforced
- **SCSS Modules**: Component-scoped styling with minimal dependencies
- **Design System**: Consistent patterns for new FlowAccount brand
- **Minimal Coupling**: Components designed for easy extraction to production codebase

### Code Conventions
- **Path Aliases**: Use `@components/*` for component imports
- **Service Injection**: Use `inject()` function for dependency injection
- **Interfaces**: Define TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Template/Style**: Separate HTML and SCSS files for components
- **Copy Management**: Sales copy and content easily modifiable for testing
- **Angular Templates**: Use `&#64;` HTML entity for @ symbols in templates (Angular 17+ interprets `@` as control flow blocks like `@if`, `@for`)

### User Profile Testing Integration (Critical for UX Recommendations)
**All new components should integrate with the User Profile Testing System** to demonstrate adaptive user experiences. The system now provides both UI-managed flags and strongly-typed methods:

```typescript
// Required integration pattern for components
import { FeatureFlagService } from '../../services/feature-flag.service';
import { UserProfileTestingService } from '../../services/user-profile-testing.service';

@Component({...})
export class MyComponent {
  private featureFlags = inject(FeatureFlagService);
  private userProfileTesting = inject(UserProfileTestingService);
  
  // Method 1: Use strongly-typed methods (for common behaviors)
  get dashboardLayout() {
    return this.featureFlags.getDashboardLayout();
  }
  
  shouldShowAdvancedFeatures() {
    return this.featureFlags.shouldShowAdvancedFeatures();
  }
  
  // Method 2: Use generic getFlag for UI-created flags
  get customFeature() {
    return this.featureFlags.getFlag<boolean>('1005_my_custom_feature');
  }
  
  // Method 3: Direct profile checking for simple conditions
  get isStudentUser() {
    return this.userProfileTesting.getCurrentTestingState().user_role === 'student';
  }
}
```

**Template patterns for adaptive UI:**
```typescript
// Conditional features based on user profile
@if (shouldShowAdvancedFeatures()) {
  <app-advanced-features />
} @else {
  <app-basic-features />
}

// Layout variations with dynamic classes
<div class="layout-{{ dashboardLayout }}">
  @switch (dashboardLayout) {
    @case ('simplified') { <app-simple-layout /> }
    @case ('advanced') { <app-advanced-layout /> }
    @default { <app-standard-layout /> }
  }
</div>

// UI-created flag integration
@if (customFeature) {
  <app-experimental-component />
}

// Profile-based styling
<nav [class.student-nav]="isStudentUser">
  <!-- Navigation adapts to user type -->
</nav>
```

**AI Integration Notes**:
- **Check current flags**: Use Feature Flags tab in testing modal or `featureFlagService.getAllFlags()`
- **Create new behaviors**: Use Feature Flags tab UI or add to registry file
- **Debug flag state**: Console logging automatically shows flag evaluation reasons
- **Test scenarios**: Use Testing tab to switch between user personas and see immediate effects

**Purpose**: This integration allows the FlowAccount development team to see exactly how features should behave for different user types, with both simple and complex behavioral logic, providing clear specifications for production implementation.

### Media Player Usage
```typescript
// Launch floating player
this.mediaPlayerService.launchFloatingPlayer({
  id: 'unique-video-id',
  url: 'path/to/video.mp4',
  title: 'Video Title',
  description: 'Video description'
});

// Launch fixed player
this.mediaPlayerService.launchFixedPlayer(config);

// Listen to state changes
this.mediaPlayerService.state$.subscribe(state => {
  // Handle state updates
});
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Planning-Driven Task Management System  

**A strategic analysis approach with focused task implementation, designed for zero-context resumability and AI collaboration.**

### Planning Documents vs Tasks

**Planning Documents** (`/dev_files/planning/`): Strategic analysis for complex, multi-faceted problems
- **Purpose**: Problem identification, root cause analysis, solution evaluation
- **Structure**: Business impact â†’ Root causes â†’ Current state â†’ Proposed solutions â†’ Metrics
- **Template**: Uses structured template based on successful onboarding strategy approach
- **Scope**: Cross-system problems requiring strategic coordination

**Tasks** (`/dev_files/tasks/`): Focused implementation work with clear deliverables
- **Purpose**: Specific technical implementation building on strategic foundation
- **Structure**: Problem â†’ Solution â†’ Implementation â†’ Acceptance criteria  
- **Scope**: Well-defined components, features, or fixes with clear boundaries

### Task Classification by Complexity

**Simple Tasks (S)**
- Single file changes, config updates, typos, styling fixes
- **Scope**: Isolated changes with minimal dependencies
- **Documentation**: TodoWrite tool only, no file creation needed

**Standard Tasks (M)**  
- Feature enhancements, new components, API endpoints, multi-file changes
- **Scope**: Well-defined changes with clear boundaries
- **Documentation**: Brief task file with clear context for resumption

**Complex Tasks (L)**
- New features, architectural changes, cross-system integrations
- **Scope**: Multiple components, potential breaking changes, research required
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive task file with decision logs and architecture notes

### Universal Task Flow

#### 1. Problem Understanding & Classification
- **Clarify the problem** and desired outcome with user
- **Classify complexity** (S/M/L) based on scope and dependencies
- **Confirm alignment** and document task appropriately

#### 2. Zero-Context Documentation Strategy

**For Simple Tasks (S):**
- Use TodoWrite tool only with descriptive task description
- Include file paths and specific changes needed

**For Standard Tasks (M):**
- Create task file: `/dev_files/tasks/active/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{brief-name}.md`
- Include enough context that a fresh AI instance can immediately understand and continue

**For Complex Tasks (L):**
- Create comprehensive task file with decision logs and research findings
- Document "AI handoff points" - everything needed to continue work

#### 3. AI-Resumable Implementation

**Status Progression:**
- `todo` - Task defined, not started
- `research` - Understanding current state and approach  
- `in_progress` - Active implementation
- `testing` - Verification phase
- `blocked` - Waiting for user input or external dependency
- `awaiting_user_approval` - Implementation complete, pending explicit user (project owner) quality/UX check
- `completed` - Only mark as completed after the user has explicitly approved the result
- `abandoned` - Stopped with documented reason

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL:**
- Every task must include a step for explicit user (project owner) quality and UX check.
- The task is only marked as `completed` after the user has reviewed and explicitly stated that it passes their standards.
- Until then, the task remains in `awaiting_user_approval` status.

**AI Handoff Requirements:**
- Current understanding of the problem
- Files already examined/modified
- Key architectural decisions made
- Next specific steps to take
- Any blockers or dependencies discovered

### AI-Scannable File Organization

**Strategic analysis and task management:**
```
/dev_files/
â”œâ”€â”€ planning/                  # Strategic analysis documents
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _PLANNING_DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md

  - REASON: Too complex without performance impact analysis

## Quick Context for AI
**How to use this system:**
1. Scan this index to understand current state
2. Read the specific task file for detailed context  
3. Ask user which task to work on or continue
4. Update task file with progress and decisions
5. Update this index when status changes

**Project Patterns:**
- Components: Angular standalone components in `/src/app/components/`
- Services: Business logic in `/src/app/services/`
- Routing: Angular Router with lazy loading
- Styling: SCSS with Angular Material theming
- Testing: Jasmine/Karma co-located with components
```

### AI Workflow Integration

**Fresh Instance Onboarding:**
1. **ALWAYS START**: Read `/dev_files/tasks/_task_index.md` for immediate context
2. **Task Selection**: Ask user: "I see {X} active tasks. Which would you like me to work on?"
3. **Get Context**: Read specific task file in `/dev_files/tasks/active/` for detailed context
4. **Sync Status**: Update TodoWrite with current understanding
5. **Work & Update**: Proceed with implementation, updating task file with progress

**TodoWrite Integration:**
- Sync TodoWrite with task file status 
- Use TodoWrite for real-time progress within a session
- Update task file at completion or when blocked

**Git Integration:**
- Branch naming: `task/{date}-{brief-name}` (e.g., `task/2025-01-17-hero-fixes`)
- Commit messages reference task: `feat: implement hero responsive design (ref: 2025-01-17-component-updates.md)`
- Move task to completed/ folder after successful merge

**Quality Gates by Complexity:**
- **S**: Manual verification, basic testing
- **M**: Component testing + linting + type checking
- **L**: Full test suite + integration tests + performance verification

### System Benefits for AI Collaboration

1. **Zero Context Resumability**: Any AI can pick up any task immediately
2. **Complexity-Appropriate**: Simple fixes don't get buried in documentation  
3. **Decision Preservation**: Architecture choices and reasoning captured
4. **Progress Transparency**: Users can see exactly where things stand
5. **Learning System**: Completed tasks become reference patterns
6. **Failure Analysis**: Abandoned tasks document what didn't work and why

**Key Innovation**: The `_task_index.md` file serves as an **AI dashboard** - scan once to understand the entire project state, then dive deep into specific tasks as needed.

5. **Provide Development Recommendations**: Clear conditional logic that production team can implement

### Building Test Hypotheses for Growth Book A/B Testing
**IMPORTANT**: When the user says "build a test hypothesis" or "create a test hypothesis", this means:
1. **Use the Test Context Template** located at `/dev_files/deliverables/output-document-templates/_TEST_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md`
2. **Create the hypothesis document** in `/dev_files/test-hypotheses/` folder
3. **Follow the IF/THEN/BECAUSE format** for hypothesis statements
4. **Include all required metadata** for Growth Book configuration

**Quick Command Reference**:
- "Build a test hypothesis" â†’ Create new test hypothesis document using template
- "Work on test hypothesis" â†’ Continue editing existing test hypothesis
- "Show test status" â†’ Display the test hypothesis index with all stages
- "Update test status" â†’ Move a test hypothesis to a different stage

**Test Hypothesis Components**:
