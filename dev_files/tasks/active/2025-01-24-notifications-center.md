# Task: Develop Notifications Center for Recent Updates
**Date**: 2025-01-24 | **Complexity**: M | **Status**: todo
**Component**: Notifications center system to house recent updates without disrupting onboarding
**Strategic Context**: Part of [Onboarding Strategy Master Plan](../../context/onboarding-strategy-master-plan.md) - Solution for Recent Updates Section

## Problem Statement
Need to preserve FlowAccount's innovation messaging and recent updates communication while removing the visual overwhelm and onboarding disruption caused by the prominent Recent Updates section on the dashboard.

## Solution Approach
Create a dedicated notifications center that houses recent updates, product announcements, and feature releases in a way that:
- Preserves trust-building benefits of showing continuous innovation
- Removes onboarding friction for new users
- Provides easy access for users who want to stay informed
- Scales for future product communications

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Notifications Center
- [ ] Create notifications center component
- [ ] Design notification data structure
- [ ] Implement basic UI (dropdown or slide-out panel)
- [ ] Add "What's New" button/icon in header
- [ ] Move existing recent updates content to notifications center

### Phase 2: Enhanced Experience
- [ ] Add notification categories (features, updates, announcements)
- [ ] Implement read/unread states
- [ ] Add notification badges for new items
- [ ] Create admin interface for managing notifications

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Recent updates no longer disrupt dashboard onboarding
- [ ] Innovation messaging preserved in accessible location
- [ ] Users can easily find and consume update information
- [ ] **Explicit user (project owner) quality/UX check and approval**

## Updates Value Metrics
To measure whether recent updates are actually delivering value to users:

### Primary Metrics
- **Click-through Rate on Updates**: % of users who click on update announcements
- **Feature Adoption from Updates**: Usage of newly announced features by users who saw the update

### Implementation Notes
- Track which updates get clicked most frequently
- Monitor time from update view to feature usage
- Compare feature adoption rates: users who saw update vs. those who didn't
- A/B test different update presentation methods within the notifications center
