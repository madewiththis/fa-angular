# Task: Learning Center Panel UI Redesign
**Date**: 2025-01-24 | **Complexity**: L | **Status**: todo  
**Component**: Learning Center slide-out panel UI complete redesign
**Strategic Context**: Part of [Learning Center Redesign Plan](../../planning/learning-center-redesign-plan.md) - Task 1 (Foundation)

## Problem Statement
The current Learning Center slide-out panel has fundamental UX issues that break user workflow and fail to meet modern expectations for contextual help systems. Users face external navigation friction, poor content discovery, and lack of intelligent assistance features. A complete UI redesign is needed to establish the foundation for AI-powered, contextual help delivery.

## Requirements
- **Redesign slide-out panel interface** - Complete visual and interaction redesign
- **URL-based curated default content** - Content populates based on current user URL/page context
- **Remove external friction points** - Eliminate tiny external links and tab-switching issues
- **Implement navigation hierarchy** - New content organization and breadcrumb system
- **Design for multiple content formats** - Support videos, instructions, short answers
- **Contextual navigation with snap-back** - Allow exploration while maintaining original context

## MVP Features (From Roadmap)
- URL-based curated default content (populates based on current user URL/page)
- Basic task-based categorization using existing Learning Center structure
- Contextual navigation with "snap back" to original Learning Center content (UI element)
- Breadcrumb navigation placeholder (UI element)
- Integrated floating media player for seamless video viewing
- Content format identification (videos, instructions, short answers)
- Progress tracking: mark content as viewed
- Content freshness monitoring: display creation/update dates (admin only)
- External link warnings with proper icons
- Seminars as Learning Center objects with contextual relevance mapping

## Current Understanding
### Existing Learning Center Components
- Learning Center slide-out panel (current implementation)
- URL-based content loading (needs enhancement)
- Basic video/FAQ listing (needs redesign)

### Integration Points
- MediaPlayerService for floating video experience
- Learning Center content system (to be enhanced in Task 2)
- User Profile Testing System for role-based future features

## Solution Approach
### UI/UX Design Strategy
- **Modern slide-out panel design** with improved visual hierarchy
- **Content cards layout** for different content types (videos, instructions, quick answers)
- **Navigation breadcrumbs** with placeholder structure for future hierarchy
- **Search placeholder area** for future AI chat integration
- **Snap-back navigation** UI elements to return to contextual content

### Content Display System
- **URL-based content curation** - Intelligent default content based on user's current page
- **Content format icons** - Visual indicators for videos, instructions, short answers
- **Content freshness indicators** - Creation/update dates (admin view only)
- **Progress indicators** - Mark content as viewed with visual feedback

### Media Integration
- **Floating player transition** - Seamless handoff from Learning Center to MediaPlayerService
- **In-panel video previews** - Thumbnail and metadata display
- **External link handling** - Warning modals with proper iconography

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core UI Structure
- [ ] Design new slide-out panel layout and visual system
- [ ] Implement URL-based content loading mechanism
- [ ] Create content card components for different formats
- [ ] Add breadcrumb navigation placeholder UI

### Phase 2: Content Integration
- [ ] Connect to existing Learning Center content structure
- [ ] Implement task-based categorization display
- [ ] Add content format identification and icons
- [ ] Create progress tracking UI (viewed status)

### Phase 3: Navigation & Interaction
- [ ] Implement contextual navigation with snap-back functionality
- [ ] Add external link warning system
- [ ] Integrate MediaPlayerService for floating video transitions
- [ ] Add content freshness monitoring display (admin only)

### Phase 4: Seminars Integration
- [ ] Design seminar content display within Learning Center
- [ ] Implement seminar objects as Learning Center content
- [ ] Add contextual relevance mapping for seminars

## Files to Modify/Create
- Learning Center panel component files (locate and examine existing structure)
- New content card components for different formats
- Navigation breadcrumb component (placeholder)
- URL-based content loading service enhancements
- MediaPlayer integration interfaces
- Content progress tracking components

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New slide-out panel design implemented with modern UI
- [ ] URL-based curated content loads automatically based on user's current page
- [ ] Content displays with proper format identification (videos, instructions, short answers)
- [ ] Contextual navigation allows exploration with snap-back to original content
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation placeholder is functional and ready for hierarchy
- [ ] MediaPlayer integration provides seamless floating video experience
- [ ] Progress tracking shows viewed content with visual indicators
- [ ] External links show proper warnings before navigation
- [ ] Seminars appear as Learning Center objects with relevant context
- [ ] Content freshness dates display for admin users
- [ ] **Explicit user (project owner) quality/UX check and approval**

## AI Handoff State
**Complete context for continuation:**
- **Current phase**: Planning and requirements definition
- **Files examined**: None yet - need to locate existing Learning Center components
- **Key insights**: Foundation task that establishes UI for all subsequent features
- **Next actions**: Locate existing Learning Center components, design new UI structure, implement URL-based content loading
- **Dependencies**: None - this is the foundation task
- **Blockers**: Need to examine current Learning Center implementation structure

## Status Log
- 2025-01-24: todo - Task created as foundation for Learning Center redesign project
