# Task: Upgrade Learning Center Content Structure
**Date**: 2025-01-24 | **Complexity**: M | **Status**: todo  
**Component**: Learning Center content model and data structure expansion
**Strategic Context**: Part of [Learning Center Redesign Plan](../../planning/learning-center-redesign-plan.md) - Task 2 (Content Foundation)

## Problem Statement
The current Learning Center content structure is limited and doesn't support the enhanced features planned for the redesigned UI. We need to expand the content model to include seminars as first-class objects, enhance content tagging for better categorization, add content freshness monitoring, and define clear content format identification to support multiple content types (videos, instructions, short answers).

## Requirements
- **Add seminars as Learning Center objects** - Integrate seminars with contextual relevance mapping
- **Enhance content tagging system** - Better categorization and discoverability
- **Content freshness monitoring** - Creation/update dates for admin content management
- **Content format identification** - Clear structure for videos, instructions, short answers
- **Maintain backward compatibility** - Existing content should continue to work

## V2 Features (From Roadmap)
- Learning Center content tagging display
- Enhanced content format variety

## Current Understanding
### Existing Content Structure
- Learning Center content system with basic video/FAQ support
- URL-based contextual content loading
- Basic content categorization

### Integration Requirements
- Must support new UI design from Task 1
- Should prepare foundation for AI search integration (Task 3)
- Needs to work with MediaPlayerService for video content

## Solution Approach
### Content Model Expansion
- **Seminar Objects**: Create seminar content type with metadata (duration, presenter, relevance indicators)
- **Content Type Definitions**: Formal structure for videos, instructions, short answers, seminars
- **Tagging System**: Enhanced tags with categories, difficulty, format, topic
- **Freshness Tracking**: Creation and last-updated dates with admin visibility

### Data Structure Enhancements
- **Content Format Identification**: Clear typing system for different content formats
- **Contextual Relevance Mapping**: System to map content (including seminars) to specific pages/tasks
- **Content Relationships**: Links between related content pieces
- **Admin Metadata**: Content management information for internal use

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- **Gradual Migration**: Existing content works while new structure is implemented
- **Content Adapters**: Translation layer between old and new content structures
- **Progressive Enhancement**: New features available as content is updated

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Content Model Definition
- [ ] Define new content type interfaces (videos, instructions, short answers, seminars)
- [ ] Create enhanced tagging system structure
- [ ] Design content freshness monitoring schema
- [ ] Plan backward compatibility approach

### Phase 2: Seminar Integration
- [ ] Create seminar content object structure
- [ ] Implement contextual relevance mapping for seminars
- [ ] Design seminar metadata (presenter, duration, topic, relevance)
- [ ] Create seminar-to-page/task mapping system

### Phase 3: Content Enhancement
- [ ] Implement enhanced content tagging system
- [ ] Add content format identification to existing content
- [ ] Create content freshness tracking (creation/update dates)
- [ ] Develop content relationship mapping

### Phase 4: Data Migration & Testing
- [ ] Migrate existing content to new structure
- [ ] Test backward compatibility
- [ ] Validate content loading performance
- [ ] Ensure admin-only freshness monitoring works correctly

## Files to Modify/Create
- Learning Center content model interfaces/types
- Content loading service enhancements
- Seminar content object definitions
- Content tagging system expansion
- Content freshness monitoring implementation
- Migration scripts for existing content
- Admin content management interfaces

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Seminars appear as Learning Center objects with contextual relevance mapping
- [ ] Enhanced content tagging system supports better categorization
- [ ] Content freshness monitoring displays creation/update dates (admin only)
- [ ] Content format identification clearly distinguishes videos, instructions, short answers
- [ ] New content structure supports multiple content formats
- [ ] Existing content continues to work without disruption
- [ ] Content loading performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] Seminar-to-page relevance mapping functions correctly
- [ ] Admin users can see content management metadata
- [ ] Content relationships and cross-references work properly
- [ ] **Explicit user (project owner) quality/UX check and approval**

## Dependencies
- **Task 1 (UI Redesign)**: New content structure must integrate with redesigned UI
- **MediaPlayerService**: Video content must work with floating player system
- **Learning Center CMS**: Content management system integration

## AI Handoff State
**Complete context for continuation:**
- **Current phase**: Planning and content model design
- **Files examined**: Need to examine existing Learning Center content structure
- **Key insights**: Content foundation task that enables enhanced UI features
- **Next actions**: Examine current content model, design new structure, implement seminar objects
- **Dependencies**: Coordination with Task 1 UI design for content display requirements
- **Blockers**: Need to understand current Learning Center content implementation

## Status Log
- 2025-01-24: todo - Task created to provide enhanced content foundation for Learning Center redesign
