# Task: Build Alternative Checkout Page (FlowAccount UI Replication)
**Date**: 2025-01-22 | **Complexity**: M | **Status**: in_progress
**Component**: Checkout Page (Alternative Version) - SECTIONAL APPROACH

## Problem Summary
The current prototype checkout page does not match the real FlowAccount checkout flow. Per user feedback, the previous attempts were "a real mess" and "terrible". Taking a sectional approach to build this correctly, one section at a time with user approval between each section.

## Current Understanding  
- **Root cause**: Trying to build the entire checkout at once led to poor quality and mismatched design
- **New Approach**: Build in sections with user approval at each stage:
  1. **CURRENT FOCUS**: Choose Payment Method section ONLY
  2. **NEXT**: Tax Invoice/Receipt section (after approval of #1)
  3. **FINAL**: Package Detail section (after approval of #2)
- **Dependencies**: Must exactly match the FlowAccount screenshot for payment method selection

## File Locations
**Alternative Checkout Component Files:**
- **TypeScript Logic**: `src/app/components/checkout/checkout-page-alt/checkout-page-alt.component.ts`
- **HTML Template**: `src/app/components/checkout/checkout-page-alt/checkout-page-alt.component.html`
- **SCSS Styling**: `src/app/components/checkout/checkout-page-alt/checkout-page-alt.component.scss`
- **Route Access**: Navigate to `/checkout-alt` to view the alternative checkout page
- **Navigation Path**: Go to `/packages` â†’ select a plan â†’ click "Start Free Trial" â†’ routes to `/checkout-alt`

## Solution Approach
**STEP 1 - Payment Method Section ONLY:**
- Focus exclusively on the "Choose payment method" section
- Must include:
  - Step number "1" with blue circle
  - "Choose payment method" title properly indented from step number
  - Three payment options: Credit Card, Scan to Pay, Bank Account
  - Proper radio button positioning (left side)
  - Correct icons above text labels
  - Exact styling and spacing as per FlowAccount design
- Get explicit user approval before moving to next section

## AI Handoff State
**Current Focus**: Payment Method Section Only
- All other sections (tax invoice, package details) should be removed/hidden for now
- Must get user approval before proceeding to next section
- Blockers: None - clear direction received

## Implementation Checklist - STEP 1 ONLY
- [ ] Remove all non-payment-method sections temporarily
- [ ] Create perfect payment method section layout
- [ ] Implement proper step number and indentation
- [ ] Add correct icons and radio button positioning
- [ ] Style exactly per FlowAccount design
- [ ] **Explicit user (project owner) approval of payment method section**

## âœ… STEP 1 COMPLETED - Payment Method Section (January 22, 2025)

### ðŸŽ¯ Step 1 Implementation Completed:
**STATUS: READY FOR USER APPROVAL** - Payment method section now matches the FlowAccount screenshot exactly:

âœ… **Credit Card Form Layout Fixed**: 
  - Card Number: Full-width row (matches screenshot)
  - Expiration Date + CVV: Side-by-side row (matches screenshot)
  - Name on card: Full-width row (matches screenshot)
âœ… **Payment Method Cards**: Proper 3-column grid with radio buttons in top-left
âœ… **Step Number & Title**: Blue circle "1" with proper indentation and spacing
âœ… **Interactive Elements**: All radio buttons and form fields working correctly
âœ… **Visual Design**: Selected payment method shows blue border and background
âœ… **Auto-renew Notice**: Properly positioned below form
âœ… **Build Verification**: All changes compile successfully

### ðŸ”„ Current Status: 
**AWAITING USER APPROVAL OF STEP 1** - Payment Method section completed per sectional approach. Once approved, ready to proceed to Step 2 (Tax Invoice/Receipt section).

## ðŸ”„ FRESH START - Component Rebuilt from Scratch (January 22, 2025)

### âœ… Complete Fresh Implementation:
**FILES RECREATED** - Previous files deleted by user, component completely rebuilt with only header and Step 1:

âœ… **Fresh TypeScript Component**: Clean component with only necessary data and methods
âœ… **Page Header**: Back button, title "Payment method", and subtitle  
âœ… **Step 1 - Choose Payment Method**: 
  - Blue circle "1" with proper indentation and spacing
  - 3-column payment method grid using FontAwesome icons:
    - Credit Card: `fas fa-credit-card`
    - Scan to Pay: `fas fa-qrcode` 
    - Bank Account: `fas fa-university`
  - Radio buttons positioned in top-left of each card
  - Selected state shows blue border and icon color change

âœ… **Credit Card Form** (when Credit Card selected):
  - Card Number: Full-width row
  - Expiration Date + CVV: Side-by-side row with FontAwesome show/hide toggle (`fa fa-eye` / `fa fa-eye-slash`)
  - Name on card: Full-width row
  - Auto-renew notice below form

âœ… **Sectional Approach**: Only Step 1 visible - no Step 2 or Payment Details until approved
âœ… **Build Verification**: All files compile successfully with no errors
âœ… **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout included
