# Task: Revolutionize Company Setup Modal Experience
**Date**: 2025-01-23 | **Complexity**: L | **Status**: pending
**Component**: Company Setup Modal with Live Document Preview

## Problem Statement
The current company setup modal doesn't explain the benefit to free trial users of completing their information accurately. Users don't understand that completing setup makes their test documents (quotes, invoices, etc.) look professional and aligned with their company branding. This leads to poor completion rates and users not experiencing the full value of FlowAccount.

## Vision: "Let's Make Your Documents Look Good"
Transform the company setup experience into a compelling, visual demonstration where users see their documents come to life as they fill out information. Show immediate value by demonstrating how their input creates professional-looking business documents.

## Inspiration Analysis
From the provided image, the concept is:
- **Left side**: Form fields for company information
- **Right side**: Live preview of a tax invoice document 
- **Real-time updates**: As users type, upload logos, select options, the document preview updates instantly
- **Motivational messaging**: "Let's make your documents look good" or "Let's set up your documents"

## Phase 4: User-Friendly Payment Method Communication (NEW)

### Problem Statement
Current sales transaction selection is too accountant-focused and confusing for regular business owners:
- Technical terms like "Cash Sale" / "Credit Sale" 
- Document lists overwhelm users instead of helping them decide
- Focuses on accounting terminology rather than business reality
- Doesn't help users understand which option fits their business

### Solution: "How do you get paid?" Approach

**Replace current section with user-friendly question:**
- [ ] **Change section title** from "Select your type of sales transaction" to "How do you get paid by your customers?"

**New Payment Method Cards:**
- [ ] **Option 1: "Get paid immediately"** ðŸ’°
  - Subtitle: "(Cash sale only)"
  - Description: "You receive payment when you deliver your service or product"
  - Examples: "Restaurants, retail stores, freelancers who collect payment on completion"
  - Maps to: 'cash' transaction type

- [ ] **Option 2: "Send invoices"** ðŸ“„  
  - Subtitle: "(Credit sale)"
  - Description: "You send bills to customers and they pay you later"
  - Examples: "Consultants, contractors, B2B services with payment terms"
  - Maps to: 'credit' transaction type

- [ ] **Option 3: "Both ways"** ðŸ”„
  - Subtitle: "(Cash and credit sale)"
  - Description: "Some customers pay immediately, others pay later"
  - Examples: "Mixed business models, different customer types"
  - Maps to: 'both' transaction type

**Remove Document Lists from Cards:**
- [ ] **Remove all document type lists** from the selection cards
- [ ] **Focus cards on business scenarios** instead of technical outputs
- [ ] **Use clear, conversational language** that any business owner understands

### Interactive Document Explorer (Below Preview)

**Add Document Type Tabs:**
- [ ] **Create tab interface** below the invoice preview
- [ ] **Tab options based on selection:**
  - Quotation
  - Invoice/Tax Invoice (depending on VAT status)
  - Receipt
  - Additional documents based on payment method + VAT combination

**Tab Functionality:**
- [ ] **Clickable tabs** that switch the document preview
- [ ] **Real-time updates** with user's company information in each document type
- [ ] **Smooth transitions** between document types
- [ ] **Active tab highlighting** to show current selection

**Document Templates:**
- [ ] **Create quotation template** - shows estimated costs for services/products
- [ ] **Create receipt template** - shows payment confirmation
- [ ] **Enhanced invoice template** - current tax invoice but also simple invoice option
- [ ] **Maintain VAT awareness** - documents adapt to VAT registration status

### UX Flow Design

**Selection Process:**
1. User reads "How do you get paid by your customers?"
2. Recognizes their business model in one of the three options
3. Clicks their payment method
4. Document preview updates to show relevant default document
5. User explores other document types via tabs
6. Gains confidence in their choice by seeing actual outputs

**Visual Feedback:**
- [ ] **Immediate preview update** when payment method changes
- [ ] **Tab availability updates** based on payment method selection
- [ ] **Document content adapts** to show relevant information for each type
- [ ] **Loading states** for smooth transitions

### Technical Implementation

**Component Updates:**
- [ ] **Update payment method cards** with new user-friendly content
- [ ] **Remove document lists** from existing cards
- [ ] **Create document tab component** for interactive exploration
- [ ] **Create additional document templates** (quotation, receipt, simple invoice)

**State Management:**
- [ ] **Add document type selection** to component state
- [ ] **Update preview switching logic** to handle multiple document types
- [ ] **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing sales transaction mapping

**CSS/Styling:**
- [ ] **Design new payment method cards** with business-focused styling
- [ ] **Create tab interface styling** that matches modal design
- [ ] **Ensure responsive behavior** for document switching on mobile
- [ ] **Add transition effects** for smooth document type changes

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users immediately understand which payment method fits their business
