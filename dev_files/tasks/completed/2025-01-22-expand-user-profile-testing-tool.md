# Task: Expand User Profile Testing Tool with Conditional Behaviors
**Date**: 2025-01-22 | **Complexity**: L | **Status**: completed
**Component**: User Profile Testing System - Unified Scenario-Based Testing Tool

## Problem Statement
The current User Profile Testing tool only allows toggling basic user profile fields (role, business_type, package, etc.). We need to **expand this into a comprehensive scenario-based testing system** that:

1. **Creates centralized behavioral registry** - Single source of truth linking user profile conditions to app behaviors
2. **Uses profile conditions to trigger different experiences** throughout the app with clean, maintainable logic
3. **Provides visual feedback** showing all current behavioral variations in an easily scannable format
4. **Enables comprehensive testing scenarios** with preset user personas and feature combinations
5. **Improves the UI/UX** of the testing modal with organized layout and live preview
6. **Maintains clean architecture** with strongly typed methods and consistent naming conventions

**Key Innovation**: Centralized feature flag registry that maps cookie dimensions to feature flags, preventing messy code and providing a maintainable system for testing different user experiences.

## Current State Analysis
### Existing User Profile Testing System
- **Location**: `/src/app/services/user-profile-testing.service.ts`
- **Modal Component**: `/src/app/components/user-profile-testing/modal/user-profile-testing-modal.component.ts`
- **Current Fields**:
  - `user_role` - Owner, Accountant, Staff, etc.
  - `business_type` - Service business, E-commerce, Restaurant, etc.
  - `package` - Free Trial, Standard, Pro, Pro Business
  - `package_status` - Active, Expired, Expiring
  - `payment_frequency` - Monthly, Annual
  - `payment_method` - Credit Card, Bank Transfer, QR Code
  - User profile data: email, first_name, last_name, company_name
  - Exit survey fields: exit_survey_*

### Current UI Issues
- **No visual feedback** of current state outside the modal
- **Cramped modal interface** with all dropdowns in a single column
- **Limited feature flag capabilities** - only basic user profile fields
- **No quick overview** of what's currently enabled/disabled

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Create Centralized Feature Flag Architecture
- [ ] **Create Feature Flag Registry** (`/src/app/config/feature-flag-registry.ts`)
  - Define simple FeatureFlagDefinition interface (id, name, description, conditions, defaultValue)
  - Add optional fields for future extensibility (conflicts?, category?)
  - Define FeatureFlagCondition interface with basic operators (equals, includes, not_equals)
  - Create FEATURE_FLAG_REGISTRY array as single source of truth
  - Document all feature flags with clear descriptions and demo use cases

- [ ] **Design Feature Flag Evaluation Engine**
  - Create FeatureFlagService with generic getFlag<T>() method
  - Implement simple condition evaluation logic with graceful fallbacks
  - Add strongly typed helper methods (getDashboardLayout(), shouldShowPremiumFeatures())
  - Include basic error handling that falls back to default values
  - Ensure type safety and IntelliSense support for easy development

- [ ] **Identify Initial Feature Flag Opportunities**
  - Dashboard layout variations (simplified/standard/advanced based on user_role)
  - Premium features visibility (based on package + package_status)
  - Onboarding flow types (quick/standard/enterprise based on business_type)
  - Pricing display emphasis (monthly/annual/enterprise based on business context)
  - Landing page hero variations (accountant/business_owner/student/default)
  - Tutorial mode complexity (beginner/intermediate/advanced)

- [ ] **Establish Naming Conventions**
  - Flag IDs: snake_case (e.g., dashboard_layout, show_premium_features)
  - Service methods: camelCase with clear prefixes (get*, should*, is*, has*)
  - Consistent terminology and logical grouping

### Phase 2: Redesign Testing Modal with Live Feature Flag Preview
- [ ] **Create Two-Panel Modal Layout**:
  - **Left Panel**: Live Feature Flag Status Display
    - Show all active feature flags with current values
    - Color coding: Green (active/custom), Gray (default), Red (disabled)
    - Flag descriptions from registry for clarity
    - Real-time updates as cookie values change
    - "Why is this active?" tooltips showing triggering conditions
  - **Right Panel**: Cookie Value Controls
    - Organized tabs: User Profile, Business Context, System Settings
    - Clean dropdown interfaces with clear labels
    - Immediate visual feedback in left panel
    - Auto-save state between sessions for demo continuity

- [ ] **Add Feature Flag Status Dashboard**:
  - Compact cards showing: Flag ID, Current Value, Description
  - Visual indicators for which cookie values trigger which flags
  - "Why is this active?" tooltip showing the triggering condition
  - Quick jump to relevant cookie controls

- [ ] **Implement Preset Scenarios System**:
  - "New Business Owner" - owner + service_business + free_trial
  - "Experienced Accountant" - accountant + pro + active + annual
  - "Student User" - student + any business + free_trial
  - "Enterprise Client" - owner + manufacturing + pro_business + active
  - Save/load custom combinations with meaningful names
  - One-click scenario switching with preview of all flag changes

### Phase 3: Integrate Feature Flags into App Components
- [ ] **Implement FeatureFlagService Integration**:
  - Inject FeatureFlagService into key components
  - Replace hardcoded conditionals with feature flag checks
  - Use strongly typed methods for IntelliSense and safety
  - Add performance monitoring for flag evaluation

- [ ] **Update Key Components with Feature Flag Logic**:
  - **Landing Page**: Hero section variants based on user_role
  - **Dashboard**: Layout switching (simplified/standard/advanced)
  - **Onboarding**: Flow selection (quick/standard/enterprise) 
  - **Pricing Page**: Emphasis switching (monthly/annual/enterprise focus)
  - **Checkout**: Process variations based on business_type
  - **Navigation**: Premium features visibility based on package status

- [ ] **Create Template Usage Patterns**:
  ```typescript
  // Component property pattern
  get dashboardLayout() { return this.featureFlags.getDashboardLayout(); }
  
  // Template switch pattern  
  @switch (dashboardLayout) {
    @case ('simplified') { <app-simple-dashboard /> }
    @case ('advanced') { <app-advanced-dashboard /> }
    @default { <app-standard-dashboard /> }
  }
  
  // Boolean flag pattern
  @if (featureFlags.shouldShowPremiumFeatures()) {
    <app-premium-features />
  }
  ```

### Phase 4: Demo-Focused Developer Experience
- [ ] **Add Smart Testing Mode Indicator**:
  - Floating badge showing active persona ("Owner + Service Business + Pro")
  - Color-coded status: Blue (testing mode), Green (production-like)
  - Quick access popup with most common scenario switches
  - Visual reminder that feature flags are actively modifying the experience

- [ ] **Implement Simple Debugging Tools**:
  - Console.warn logging for flag failures with fallback notices
  - Dev-mode only warnings for missing flags or invalid registry entries
  - Simple "Flag Trace" - Show which cookie values triggered each flag

- [ ] **Add Progressive Enhancement Hooks**:
  - Build capability for conflict resolution (implement but don't expose unless needed)
  - Structure service for future caching if performance becomes an issue
  - Design registry to accept additional optional fields without breaking changes
  - Keep advanced features behind "Advanced Mode" toggle in modal

## Technical Architecture Decisions
### Simplified but Extensible Registry Pattern
```typescript
// Simple Feature Flag Registry (Easy to Configure, Room to Grow)
interface FeatureFlagDefinition {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  defaultValue: boolean | string | number;
  conditions: FeatureFlagCondition[];
  // Optional future fields (only add when needed):
  conflicts?: string[]; // For mutual exclusion if required
  category?: 'ui' | 'behavior' | 'access'; // For organization if needed
}

interface FeatureFlagCondition {
  cookieField: string;
  operator: 'equals' | 'includes' | 'not_equals'; // Easy to extend
  value: unknown;
  result: unknown;
}

// Example Registry Entry
export const FEATURE_FLAG_REGISTRY: FeatureFlagDefinition[] = [
  {
    id: 'dashboard_layout',
    name: 'Dashboard Layout Variant', 
    description: 'Controls dashboard complexity based on user role',
    defaultValue: 'standard',
    conditions: [
      { cookieField: 'user_role', operator: 'equals', value: 'student', result: 'simplified' },
      { cookieField: 'user_role', operator: 'equals', value: 'owner', result: 'advanced' }
    ]
  }
];

// Service Implementation with Graceful Degradation
getFlag<T>(flagId: string): T {
  try {
    const flagDef = FEATURE_FLAG_REGISTRY.find(f => f.id === flagId);
    const currentState = this.userProfileTestingService.testingState();
    return this.evaluateConditions(flagDef, currentState);
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn(`Feature flag '${flagId}' failed, using default`);
    return this.getDefaultValue(flagId);
  }
}

// Strongly Typed Component Usage
get dashboardLayout() {
  return this.featureFlags.getDashboardLayout(); // Returns 'simplified' | 'standard' | 'advanced'
}
```

### Demo-Focused Modal UI Strategy
- **Left Panel**: Live flag status display - auto-generated from registry
- **Right Panel**: Cookie controls organized by business context  
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple interface by default, "Advanced" toggle for future features
- **One-Click Scenarios**: Quick switching between demo personas
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators of active flags and triggering conditions
- **Self-Documenting**: Flag descriptions and logic visible in UI
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new flags - everything updates automatically
