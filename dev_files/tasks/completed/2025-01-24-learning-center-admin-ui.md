# Task: Learning Center Admin UI
**Date**: 2025-01-24 | **Complexity**: L | **Status**: completed
**Component**: Learning Center Admin Interface
**Parent Task**: [Learning Content Foundation](2025-01-24-learning-content-foundation.md)

## Problem Statement

Create a comprehensive admin interface for the Learning Center that allows non-technical users to manage the complete Goals â†’ Workflows â†’ Tasks hierarchy. The interface should support content creation, editing, relationship management, and provide a user-friendly way to build learning experiences without touching code.

## Vision: Complete Content Management System

### Core Admin Personas
1. **Content Managers**: Create and edit learning content
2. **UX Designers**: Structure learning flows and user journeys  
3. **Business Stakeholders**: Define goals and success metrics
4. **AI Assistants**: Bulk content creation and optimization

## Comprehensive Use Cases Analysis

### ðŸ“‹ **Content Creation & Management**

#### **Goal Management**
- [ ] **Create New Goal**
  - Goal name, description, business value
  - Define applicable user roles (owner, accountant, etc.) my-note: requires unbreakable mapping between flowaccounts defined roles (which may change) and this system.
  - Define applicable business types (service, retail, etc.) my-note: same issue as above
  - Set success metrics and expected outcomes
  - Choose status (draft, published, archived)
  my-note: The goal could actually have an article, video, and content assigned to it as well. I realized the same thing for a workflow. 
What I had originally envisaged for the task, we actually need to provide the same types of content for a goal and for a workflow. 
For example, that could include multiple video links, Blog articles, prompts that we can then use for the future AI. There are quite a few things that we need to link to all three of these key objects.

## MVP Implementation Plan (Simplified)

### **Phase 1: Basic CRUD MVP (S-M)**
**Goal**: Get basic content management working with minimal complexity
- [ ] Simple forms for creating/editing Goals, Workflows, Tasks
- [ ] Basic list views with edit/delete buttons
- [ ] Simple dropdown relationship assignment (no drag-and-drop)
- [ ] Basic validation (required fields only)
- [ ] JSON import/export for AI collaboration

**MVP Scope Decisions**:
- **Roles/Business Types**: Store as flexible strings, not enums (future-proof)

- **No Advanced Features**: No drag-drop, no analytics, no collaboration
- **Focus**: Get the data model working and editable

### **Phase 2: Relationship Management (M)**
- Visual relationship assignment (simple dropdowns/multi-select)
- Content validation and integrity checking
- Basic search and filtering

### **Phase 3: Enhanced UX (L)**
- Drag-and-drop relationship builder
- Real-time preview system
- Advanced bulk operations

### **Phase 4: Production Features (L)**
- AI-assisted content creation
- Analytics and monitoring
- Content versioning system
