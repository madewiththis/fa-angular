# Task: Checkout Abandonment Exit Survey
**Date**: 2025-01-22 | **Complexity**: M | **Status**: completed
**Component**: Checkout Exit Survey Modal

## Problem Summary
Need to implement an exit intent survey that appears when users are about to leave the checkout page. The survey should detect when the cursor moves above the content section (near the toolbar area) and present users with a modal asking why they want to leave, with options to stay or provide feedback.

## Current Understanding  
- **Root cause**: No exit intent detection or abandonment feedback collection on checkout pages
- **Affected files**: 
  - New component: `src/app/components/checkout/exit-survey/` (to be created)
  - Checkout pages: `checkout-page.component.ts` and `checkout-page-alt.component.ts` (integration)
  - Potentially shared modal service if reusable across other pages
- **Dependencies**: Mouse event tracking, modal display logic, analytics integration for survey responses

## Solution Approach
- **Strategy**: Create a reusable exit survey component that can be integrated into checkout pages. Use mouse event listeners to detect when cursor moves to the top of the viewport (exit intent), then show modal with survey options. Implement response handling and analytics tracking.
- **Files to modify**: 
  - Create new `exit-survey.component.ts/html/scss` in `src/app/components/checkout/exit-survey/`
  - Integrate into `checkout-page.component.ts` and `checkout-page-alt.component.ts`
  - Update routing/guards if needed for analytics
- **Testing approach**: Test exit intent detection by moving cursor to top of page, verify modal appears correctly, test all survey options and response handling, verify analytics tracking

## AI Handoff State
**If someone else picks this up, they need to know:**
- Files already examined: Task file created, image reference shows desired UI layout
- Decisions made: Will create reusable component that can be used across checkout pages
- Current progress: Task created and added to todo system
- Blockers: None

## Survey Requirements (from image reference)
**Modal Content:**
- Title: "What is the reason you want to leave?"
- Radio button options:
  - "It's too expensive for me"
  - "I still have questions"
  - "I need to check with someone first" 
  - "It's missing a feature I need"
  - "Something went wrong in the checkout"
  - "Others"
- Buttons: "Confirm" (gray) and "Stay on this page" (blue)

**Behavior:**
- Trigger: Cursor moves above content section (exit intent)
- Modal should prevent exit and capture feedback
- "Stay on this page" closes modal and keeps user
- "Confirm" can either allow exit or show follow-up actions
- Analytics tracking for all interactions

## Implementation Summary
**Files Created:**
- `src/app/components/checkout/exit-survey/exit-survey.component.ts` - Main component logic with exit intent detection
- `src/app/components/checkout/exit-survey/exit-survey.component.html` - Modal template matching design

- Added to `checkout-page.component.html` template
- Build successful - no compilation errors

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Exit Intent Detection**: Triggers when cursor moves within 50px of top of viewport
- **Survey Modal**: Exact replica of provided design with all 6 reason options
- **Interactive Elements**: Radio buttons, confirm/stay buttons, proper disabled states
- **Analytics Ready**: Google Analytics integration (gtag) with event tracking
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized layout for mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Proper labeling and keyboard navigation

**Exit Intent Logic:**
- Detects mouse movement near top of screen (‚â§50px from top)
- Also triggers on mouse leave events
- Only shows once per session (hasShownSurvey flag)
- Clean event listener management (setup/cleanup)

## ‚ú® Enhanced Features (Post-Implementation)
**Variable Naming System for User Experience Tracking:**
- `COST`: "It's too expensive for me" - Enable targeted pricing/discount offers
- `QUESTIONS`: "I still have questions" - Direct to FAQ or live support  
- `APPROVAL`: "I need to check with someone first" - Show collaboration features
- `MISSING-FEATURE`: "It's missing a feature I need" - Display roadmap or alternatives
- `CHECKOUT-ERROR`: "Something went wrong in the checkout" - Trigger troubleshooting flow
- `OTHER`: "Others" - Generic handling with custom text collection

**"Others" Option Enhancement:**
- **Dynamic Textarea**: Appears below options when "Others" is selected
- **Required Input**: Confirm button disabled until user provides custom reason
- **Seamless UX**: Textarea hides automatically when different option selected
- **Data Collection**: Custom text captured separately in `otherText` field

**Improved Analytics Tracking:**
- **Structured Data**: Each response includes `reason_id`, `reason_text`, and `other_reason`
- **Personalization Ready**: Variable names enable targeted user experience flows
- **Complete Context**: Full user feedback captured for analysis and follow-up

**Cookie Memory Storage (Unified System):**
- **Unified Service**: Integrated with existing `UserProfileTestingService` for comprehensive user tracking
- **Single Cookie**: All user testing data (profile + exit survey) stored in `user_profile_testing_state` cookie
- **30-Day Persistence**: Consistent with existing user profile testing system
- **Consistent Logging**: Uses üß™ emoji prefix consistent with user testing system
- **Comprehensive State**: Exit survey data included in overall testing state structure
- **Cross-Session Tracking**: User behavior and preferences persist across sessions

**Exit Survey Data Structure in Unified Cookie:**
- `exit_survey_reason_id`: Variable name (COST, QUESTIONS, etc.)
- `exit_survey_reason_text`: Human-readable reason
- `exit_survey_other_text`: Custom text when "OTHER" selected
- `exit_survey_action`: User action (confirm/stay)
- `exit_survey_timestamp`: ISO timestamp of survey completion
- `exit_survey_page`: Page where survey was triggered

## üîç Console Log Examples (Unified System)

When a user completes the exit survey, you'll see these console logs:

**1. Exit Survey Storage:**
```javascript
üß™ === STORING EXIT SURVEY RESPONSE ===
üß™ Exit survey data received: {reasonId: "COST", reason: "It's too expensive for me", otherText: "", action: "confirm", page: "checkout"}
üß™ === SAVING STATE TO COOKIES ===
üß™ Current state to save: {user_role: "any", package: "pro", exit_survey_reason_id: "COST", ...}
üß™ Testing state saved to cookies
üß™ Exit survey response stored and saved to cookies
üß™ === END STORING EXIT SURVEY RESPONSE ===
```

**2. Complete State Logging:**
```javascript
üß™ Current User Profile Testing State: {
  user_role: "any",
  package: "any", 
  package_status: "any",
  payment_frequency: "any",
  payment_method: "any",
  exit_survey: {
    reason_id: "COST",
    reason_text: "It's too expensive for me",
    other_text: undefined,
    action: "confirm",
    timestamp: "2025-01-22T19:54:23.456Z",
    page: "checkout"
  }
}
```

**3. Data Retrieval:**
```javascript
üß™ Exit survey data requested: {
  reasonId: "COST",
  reason: "It's too expensive for me", 
  otherText: undefined,
  action: "confirm",
  timestamp: "2025-01-22T19:54:23.456Z",
  page: "checkout"
}
```

## üéØ Benefits of Unified System

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All user testing data in one place
2. **Consistent Management**: Same cookie handling, logging, and debugging tools
3. **Comprehensive Tracking**: User profile + exit behavior in unified state
4. **Easy Access**: Any component can access both profile and exit survey data
5. **Developer Tools**: Existing user testing modal can be extended to show exit survey data
6. **Persistent Context**: Exit survey data persists with user profile across sessions
