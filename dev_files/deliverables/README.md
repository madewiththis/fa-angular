- `2025-02-01-signup-flow-optimization-prd.md`

### `/implementation-guides/` - Technical Handoff Documentation
**Purpose**: Bridge between UX prototype and production implementation
**Contents**:
- Component migration guides
- Asset requirements and specifications
- Technical implementation notes
- Performance and accessibility requirements
- Integration considerations

**Naming Convention**: `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{feature-area}-implementation.md`
**Examples**:
- `2025-01-25-hero-section-implementation.md`
- `2025-01-28-navigation-component-migration.md`

### `/demo-materials/` - Stakeholder Presentation Assets
**Purpose**: Materials for demonstrating UX improvements to team and stakeholders
**Contents**:
- Before/after comparison documents
- User journey maps and flow diagrams
- Business case presentations
- Demo scripts and talking points
- Screenshots and interaction videos

**Naming Convention**: `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{demo-type}-{audience}.md`
**Examples**:
- `2025-01-30-landing-page-demo-product-team.md`
- `2025-02-05-full-ux-presentation-leadership.md`

## Creation Workflow

### When to Create Deliverables
**Trigger**: Complete a UX improvement in the prototype that addresses a conversion fallout point
**Process**:
1. **Complete prototype implementation** (landing page or app interface improvement)
2. **Document the improvement** with appropriate PRD and implementation guide
3. **Create demo materials** for stakeholder presentation
4. **Update Growth Book test specifications** with A/B testing requirements

### Documentation Standards
**Quality Requirements**:
- **Comprehensive**: Enough detail for development team to implement
- **Actionable**: Clear specifications and requirements
- **Business-Focused**: Connect to conversion improvements and business metrics
- **Growth Book Ready**: Include A/B test specifications and success metrics

### Review Process
**Internal Review**:
- Technical feasibility (can dev team implement?)
- Business alignment (does this address conversion fallouts?)
- Completeness (all implementation details covered?)
- Growth Book integration (clear testing strategy?)

## Growth Book Integration Requirements

### Test Specifications (Include in all PRDs)
**Required Elements**:
- **Hypothesis**: What improvement do we expect and why?
- **Test Variations**: Control vs. treatment descriptions
- **Success Metrics**: Primary and secondary KPIs to track
- **Sample Size**: Required traffic for statistical significance
- **Test Duration**: Timeline for results evaluation
- **Rollback Plan**: What to do if metrics worsen

### Feature Flag Requirements
**Implementation Notes**:
- Feature flag names and descriptions
- Rollout strategy (percentage of users, user segments)
- Monitoring and alerting requirements
- Dependencies and integration points

## Template Files

### PRD Template
Located in: `/dev_files/deliverables/prds/_PRD_TEMPLATE.md`
**Key Sections**: Background, Scope of Work, Launch Plan, Risk Management, Appendix
**Special Features**: 
- Official FlowAccount PRD format with UX improvement adaptations
- Comprehensive AI instructions for each section
- Growth Book A/B testing integration throughout
- Business context integration with conversion funnel data
- Complete examples and completion checklist

### Implementation Guide Template
Located in: `/dev_files/deliverables/implementation-guides/_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_TEMPLATE.md`
**Key Sections**: Technical Implementation, Frontend Specifications, Analytics Integration, Testing Requirements, Deployment Strategy
**Special Features**:
- Complete technical bridge between prototype and production
- Growth Book feature flag configuration with code examples
- Comprehensive testing requirements and deployment phases
- Performance monitoring and rollback procedures
- Definition of done with success criteria

## Success Criteria

### Documentation Completeness
- [ ] All UX improvements have corresponding PRDs
- [ ] Implementation guides provide sufficient technical detail
- [ ] Demo materials effectively communicate business value
