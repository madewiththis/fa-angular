# Abandoned Tests

This folder contains **stopped or deprioritized test hypotheses** with documented reasons and lessons learned.

## What Goes Here

Tests that were:
- ❌ Stopped due to technical constraints
- ⏸️ Deprioritized for business reasons
- 🚫 Failed feasibility checks
- 📉 Showed negative early indicators
- 🔄 Replaced by better alternatives

## Documentation Requirements

Each abandoned test should document:
- **Reason for abandonment** - Why the test was stopped
- **Stage reached** - How far through the process it got
- **Lessons learned** - What we discovered
- **Blockers encountered** - Technical or business obstacles
- **Future considerations** - Could this be revisited later?

## Value of Abandoned Tests

These tests provide valuable insights:
- **Avoid repeating mistakes** - Learn from past failures
- **Technical limitations** - Understanding system constraints  
- **Business priority shifts** - Context for decision making
- **Resource planning** - Effort estimation for similar tests
- **Hypothesis refinement** - How to improve future test ideas

## Folder Structure

Same as other test folders:
- `test-name.md` - Updated with abandonment details
- `wireframes/` - Any design work completed
- `outputs/` - Partial deliverables created
- `assets/` - Research or analysis done

**Important**: Never delete abandoned tests - they're valuable learning resources!
