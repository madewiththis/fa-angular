# Test Context - Trial Banner Sales Contact Options

**Test ID**: AB-2025-001  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Originated By**: Tong (Warodom Kasiolarn) - Operations Manager  
**Test Hypothesis By**: CRO Team

---

## üîç Observation
**What is the user currently experiencing?**

**Current Experience Description:**
Free trial users currently see a countdown banner at the top of the dashboard showing days remaining in their trial with a single "Upgrade" button. As users progress through their trial (especially after 10-30 days), they may have questions about features, pricing, or need help evaluating if FlowAccount is right for their business. Currently, there's no easy pathway to connect with sales support directly from this high-visibility banner, forcing users to either figure things out alone or search for contact options elsewhere on the site.

**Supporting Data:**
- Current trial-to-paid conversion rate: ~21% (industry average: 30-40%)¬π
- Drop-off point: 50% of users don't engage with core features after onboarding¬π
- User feedback: [To be collected - need actual user quotes]
- Analytics insights: [To be measured - sales contact correlation data needed]

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Impact on User
**How does this impact FlowAccount/Users achievement of their goals?**

**User Impact:**
- Goal achievement blocked: Users who need sales assistance to evaluate FlowAccount properly can't easily reach out during critical decision moments
- Frustration points: Having to search for contact information when they're ready to discuss upgrading creates friction
- Alternative behaviors: Users either abandon the trial without getting questions answered, or waste time searching for contact options in footer/help sections

---

## üí° Hypothesis
**IF [this is changed] THEN [impact on metric(s)] BECAUSE [conversion theories]**

**Hypothesis Statement:**
IF we add "Call Sales" and "Request Callback" options to the trial countdown banner for users who are 10-30 days into their trial
THEN upgrade initiations will increase by 15% and checkout completions will increase by 10%
BECAUSE providing easy access to human assistance during the evaluation phase reduces uncertainty and helps users make confident purchase decisions (following the principle of reducing friction at decision points)

**Expected Results:**
- Goal metric: Trial-to-paid conversion will improve from 21% to 24.2% (+15% relative improvement)¬π
- Secondary metrics: 
  - Feature engagement rate will increase as sales can guide users to relevant features
  - Sales contact rate for trial users (baseline to be established)
  - Time from trial start to upgrade decision (baseline to be established)
- Timeline: Results expected within 4 weeks

**Supporting Theory:**
This change leverages the "assistance at the moment of need" principle. Research shows that B2B software buyers often need human interaction to validate their decision, especially for business-critical tools like accounting software. By surfacing sales contact options at the exact moment users are evaluating (10-30 days in), we reduce the effort required to get help and increase the likelihood of conversion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution
**Concisely describe the new UX experience we wish to test?**

The trial countdown banner will be enhanced with two new CTAs alongside the existing "Upgrade" button:

1. **"Call Sales" button** - Opens a modal with:
   - Sales phone number with click-to-call on mobile
   - Office hours clearly displayed
   - Option to schedule a call for later

2. **"Request Callback" button** - Opens a streamlined form with:
   - Name (pre-filled)
   - Phone number
   - Best time to call (dropdown)
   - Optional: Specific question/topic
   - Promise of callback within 2 business hours

These options only appear for users who are:
- In a free trial (not forever free)
- Between days 10-30 of their trial
- Have not already contacted sales

The buttons use secondary styling to not overshadow the primary "Upgrade" CTA but are clearly visible.

## üìö Data Sources Appendix

¬π **Conversion Funnel Data**: All statistics marked with ¬π are sourced from:
- File: `/dev_files/context/context-conversion-funnel-fallouts.md`
- Key metrics used:
  - Current trial conversion: ~21% (line 164)
  - Industry average: 30-40% (line 164)
  - Monthly signups: ~2,500 (line 163)
  - Feature engagement: 50% don't engage with core features (line 79)
  - Business goals and priorities (lines 172-177)

**Note on Missing Data**:
- User feedback quotes: Need to collect actual user testimonials
- Sales contact correlation: Need baseline measurement of current sales contact rates and their conversion impact
- Time to upgrade decision: Need to establish current baseline metrics

**Assumptions Made**:
- 10-30 day window chosen based on typical B2B SaaS trial evaluation periods
- Expected improvements (15% for goal metric) are conservative estimates based on industry benchmarks for adding human assistance to self-serve trials
- Trial user volume estimation assumes 60% of monthly signups are in the 10-30 day window at any given time
