Hi Tong,

Thanks for suggesting the trial banner sales contact test idea - we've developed it into a full test hypothesis and it's looking really promising for improving our trial-to-paid conversion rates.

We're now at the technical planning stage and need your input on how to handle the sales integration side. Specifically, we have two main questions:

### 1. Callback Request Integration
For the "Request Callback" feature in the trial banner, we need to understand:
- **Where should callback requests go?** (HubSpot, another CRM, direct to sales team?)
- **What information should we capture?** (Name, phone, best time to call, specific questions?)
- **How quickly can the sales team respond?** (We're promising callbacks within 2 business hours)
- **Any specific workflow or routing needed?** (Different reps for different customer segments?)

### 2. "Call Sales" Direct Contact
For the direct "Call Sales" option:
- **What phone number should we display?** (Main sales line, dedicated trial support line?)
- **Office hours to show?** (When can users expect to reach someone?)
- **Call tracking integration?** (Do we need to track which calls came from the trial banner?)
- **Handoff process?** (How should sales reps be briefed that these are trial users considering upgrade?)

### 3. Lead Data Integration
Since these will be trial users expressing sales interest:
- **HubSpot integration required?** (Auto-create leads/update existing records?)
- **Data to pass through?** (Trial status, days remaining, usage patterns?)
- **Lead scoring impact?** (Should banner interaction increase lead scores?)
- **Follow-up sequences?** (Any automated nurturing campaigns to trigger?)

### 4. Success Metrics Integration
For measuring test success:
- **Can we track callbackâ†’conversion rates?** (Need to connect banner clicks to eventual purchases)
- **Sales attribution needed?** (Which conversions came from sales assistance vs self-serve?)
- **Reporting requirements?** (What metrics do you need to see from the sales side?)

Let me know your thoughts on these integration points. We're aiming to have this test ready for development within the next couple of weeks, so any technical requirements or constraints would be helpful to know upfront.

Also, if there are any specific sales processes or tools we should be aware of for this integration, please let us know.

Thanks again for the great test idea!

Best regards,
