# Open Tests

This folder contains **active test hypotheses** that are currently in development or running.

## Test Lifecycle in Open/

Tests in this folder can be at any stage:
- **Ideation** - Gathering data and defining solution
- **Dev Research** - Checking technical feasibility  
- **Designing** - Creating wireframes and UX flows
- **In Development** - Being built by development team
- **Test in Progress** - Live in Growth Book

## Folder Structure

Each test has its own folder with:
- `test-name.md` - Main hypothesis document
- `wireframes/` - Design files and mockups
- `outputs/` - Generated PRDs, implementation guides, etc.
- `assets/` - Supporting files (images, videos, etc.)

## Moving Tests

When a test is finished, move the entire folder to:
- `../completed/` - Test completed with results documented
- `../abandoned/` - Test stopped or deprioritized

**Never delete test folders** - always move them to preserve learnings and audit trail.
