## 📋 How to Use This Index

### For AI Instances:
1. **Check this index first** when asked about test hypotheses status
2. **Update after creating/modifying** any test hypothesis
3. **Move tests between stages** as they progress
4. **Keep descriptions brief** but clear (one line max)

### Stage Progression:
1. **Ideation** → Dev Research → Designing → Designs Approved
2. **Designs Approved** → In Development → Approved Tests
3. **Approved Tests** → Test in Progress → Report Being Finalised
4. **Report Being Finalised** → Report Finalised

### Special States:
- **Gone To Sleep**: Long-term pause, not actively worked on
- **Pause**: Temporary hold, will resume soon

### Priority Levels:
- **S1**: Critical - Blocking major conversions
- **S2**: High - Significant conversion impact
- **S3**: Medium - Moderate improvement opportunity
- **S4**: Low - Minor optimization

### Updating This Index:
When updating, include:
- Test name (matches filename without .md)
- Brief one-line description
- Priority level (S1-S4)
- Current status within the stage
- Link to the test hypothesis file
