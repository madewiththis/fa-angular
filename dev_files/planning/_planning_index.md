## Planning Document Template

**Template**: [`_PLANNING_DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md`](_PLANNING_DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md)

**Structure**:
1. **Core Problem Statement** - Business impact and metrics
2. **Root Causes Analysis** - Evidence-based problem identification  
3. **Current State Analysis** - Detailed system/component examination
4. **Proposed Solutions** - Strategic approaches with success metrics
5. **Implementation Priority** - Phased approach with dependencies
6. **Success Measurement** - KPIs and measurement methodology
7. **Risk Assessment** - Implementation risks and mitigation

## When to Create Planning Documents

**Criteria for Planning Document vs Direct Task**:

✅ **Create Planning Document** when:
- Problem affects multiple systems or user journeys
- Multiple root causes require identification and prioritization  
- Business impact needs measurement with specific metrics
- Multiple solution approaches need evaluation and comparison
- Strategic coordination required across teams or features
- User research or behavioral analysis needed

❌ **Create Direct Task** when:
- Clear, focused deliverable with well-understood scope
- Technical implementation of established solution
- Bug fix or enhancement with obvious approach  
- Component or feature development with defined requirements

## AI Usage Instructions

**For AI Instances**:
1. **Check Planning First**: Review active planning documents before creating tasks
2. **Link Strategy to Implementation**: Reference planning documents in task strategic context
3. **Update Planning Documents**: Add new insights and solution refinements
4. **Maintain Relationships**: Keep planning document → task links current

**Planning Document Workflow**:
1. **Strategic Analysis**: Complete problem identification and root cause analysis
2. **Solution Definition**: Propose and evaluate multiple approaches  
3. **Task Generation**: Break solutions into focused implementation work
4. **Progress Tracking**: Update planning document as tasks complete and insights emerge
