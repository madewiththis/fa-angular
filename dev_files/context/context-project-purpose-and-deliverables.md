# Project Purpose & Deliverables - UX Improvement Pipeline

**Context Type**: Project Strategy | **Last Updated**: 2025-01-21
**Relevance**: All tasks - this defines why we're building this prototype

## Executive Summary
This Angular codebase is a **UX improvement pipeline** for FlowAccount. The goal is to create superior user experiences, document them systematically, and provide implementation guidance for the production team to test via Growth Book A/B testing platform.

## Project Purpose & Scope

### Primary Objective
Create improved UX-only versions of:
1. **FlowAccount Landing Page** - Enhanced conversion funnel and user journey
2. **FlowAccount App Interface** - Improved dashboard, navigation, and feature discovery

### Target Outcomes
- **Higher Conversion Rates**: Reduce funnel fallouts (see conversion-funnel-fallouts.md)
- **Better User Experience**: Smoother onboarding and feature adoption
- **Data-Driven Improvements**: Testable hypotheses backed by UX research
- **Production Implementation**: Clear roadmap for dev team integration

### NOT in Scope
- Backend functionality or API integration
- Production-ready code quality (prototype-level is sufficient)
- Full feature implementation (UX demonstration focus)
- Database design or business logic changes

## Process Workflow

### Phase 1: UX Prototyping (Current Phase)
**Goal**: Create superior user experiences in Angular prototype
**Activities**:
- Landing page conversion optimization
- App interface and navigation improvements  
- User flow enhancements
- Visual design and interaction improvements
- Mobile responsiveness optimization

**Success Criteria**: Demonstrable UX improvements that address conversion fallout points

### Phase 2: Documentation & Analysis
**Goal**: Produce comprehensive documentation for team implementation
**Deliverables Required**:

#### A. Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- **Landing Page PRD**: Detailed specifications for improved landing experience
- **App Interface PRD**: Dashboard and navigation enhancement specifications
- **Feature Enhancement PRDs**: Individual feature improvement documentation

#### B. UX Research & Analysis
- **Before/After Comparisons**: Visual documentation of improvements
- **User Journey Maps**: Updated flows showing reduced friction points
- **Interaction Specifications**: Detailed interaction behaviors and animations
- **Responsive Design Guidelines**: Mobile and tablet experience specifications

#### C. Implementation Guidance
- **Technical Implementation Notes**: How to integrate UX improvements into production codebase
- **Growth Book Test Specifications**: A/B test designs and success metrics
- **Asset Requirements**: Images, videos, copy changes needed
- **Performance Considerations**: Any technical requirements or constraints

### Phase 3: Team Demonstration & Handoff
**Goal**: Transfer knowledge and get team buy-in for implementation
**Activities**:
- **Live Demonstrations**: Show improved UX flows to product and dev teams
- **Stakeholder Presentations**: Present business case and expected impact
- **Technical Handoff**: Guide development team on implementation approach
- **Growth Book Setup**: Help configure A/B tests and success metrics

## Growth Book Integration Context

### Testing Platform Overview
- **Platform**: Growth Book - Feature flagging and A/B testing
- **Purpose**: Test UX improvements against current production experience
- **Success Metrics**: Conversion rate improvements, user engagement metrics
- **Implementation**: Feature flags to toggle between old/new experiences

### A/B Testing Strategy
**Test Categories**:
- **Landing Page Tests**: Hero section, pricing presentation, signup flow
- **App Interface Tests**: Dashboard layout, navigation structure, onboarding flow
- **Feature Discovery Tests**: How users find and adopt key features

**Test Design Requirements**:
- Clear hypothesis based on conversion funnel insights
- Measurable success criteria (specific % improvements)
- Statistical significance planning (sample sizes, test duration)
- Rollback plans for negative results

### Metrics & Success Criteria
**Primary Metrics** (align with conversion-funnel-fallouts.md):
- Landing page signup conversion rate
- Form completion rates
- First login within 24 hours
- Feature adoption rates
- Trial-to-paid conversion

**Secondary Metrics**:
- Time on page, scroll depth
- Session duration, page views per session
- User engagement scores
- Customer support ticket reduction
