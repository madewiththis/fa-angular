# Task: Purpose-Specific Dashboard System
**Date**: 2025-01-24 | **Complexity**: L | **Status**: todo
**Component**: Multi-tab dashboard system with dedicated views for specific business workflows
**Strategic Context**: Part of [Onboarding Strategy Master Plan](../../context/onboarding-strategy-master-plan.md) - Solution for Dashboard Components Below Fold

## Problem Statement
The current single dashboard approach creates two problems:
1. **For evaluation**: Users can't understand dashboard value due to empty states
2. **For productivity**: Experienced users see a cluttered interface mixing onboarding with actual work

## Solution Vision: Purpose-Specific Dashboard Tabs

### Current Implementation (Prototype)
Based on the provided screenshot, we have:
- **Get Started**: Onboarding and evaluation workflows
- **Overview**: Traditional comprehensive dashboard  
- **Collect Money**: Workflow-focused dashboard for revenue collection processes
- **Pay Bills**: Workflow-focused dashboard for expense management processes

### Expanded System Architecture
Create a tabbed dashboard system where each tab serves a specific business purpose:

1. **Get Started Tab**
   - Onboarding flows and feature discovery
   - User evaluation and activation processes
   - Learning content and walkthroughs
   - No clutter from business data

2. **Overview Tab** 
   - Traditional comprehensive business overview
   - High-level metrics and KPIs
   - Cross-functional insights
   - Preserved for experienced users

3. **Collect Money Tab**
   - Revenue-focused workflows and metrics
   - Quote → Invoice → Payment tracking
   - Customer communication tools
   - Cash flow optimization features

4. **Pay Bills Tab**
   - Expense management workflows
   - Vendor payment tracking
   - Budget management tools
   - Cost control features

## Design Principles

### User Experience
- **Single Purpose**: Each tab focused on specific business outcomes
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
- **Contextual Relevance**: Show only what matters for current workflow
- **Clear Navigation**: Easy movement between related functions

### Technical Architecture
- **Modular Components**: Each tab uses shared components differently
- **Lazy Loading**: Load tab content only when accessed
- **State Isolation**: Tab states don't interfere with each other
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to add new purpose-specific tabs

## Benefits

### For New Users (Evaluation)
