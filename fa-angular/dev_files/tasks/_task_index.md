## Quick Context for AI
**How to use this system:**
1. Scan this index to understand current state
2. Read the specific task file for detailed context  
3. Ask user which task to work on or continue
4. Update task file with progress and decisions
5. Update this index when status changes

**Project Patterns:**
- **Components**: Angular standalone components in `/src/app/components/`
- **Services**: Business logic in `/src/app/services/`
- **Routing**: Angular Router with lazy loading
- **Styling**: SCSS with Angular Material theming
- **Testing**: Jasmine/Karma co-located with components
- **Assets**: Media files and images in `/src/assets/`

**Current Project Focus:**
- FlowAccount.com prototype development
- New branding and design language testing
- Stakeholder demo preparation at flowaccount.vercel.com
- Frontend-only prototype (no backend integration needed)

**Common Task Areas:**
- Landing page components and hero sections
- Media player functionality and positioning
- Authentication/password protection for demos
- Responsive design improvements
- Component styling and branding updates
- Video asset integration and management

**Development Environment:**
- Local development: `ng serve` (port 4200)
- Production build: `ng build`
- Live demo: flowaccount.vercel.com
- Repository: Private GitHub repo (madewiththis/fa-angular)

**Documentation Output:**
- **Location**: `/dev_files/deliverables/` - PRDs, implementation guides, and demo materials
- **Purpose**: Document UX improvements for team implementation and Growth Book testing
- **Created When**: UX improvements are completed in prototype

**Context Knowledge Base:**
- **Location**: `/dev_files/context/` - Universal project knowledge and business insights
- **Available Contexts**:
  - `project-purpose-and-deliverables.md` - **CRITICAL**: Ultimate purpose and expected deliverables
  - `conversion-funnel-fallouts.md` - Key areas where users drop off in signup/onboarding
  - *(More contexts will be added as needed)*
- **Usage**: Reference relevant context files when working on tasks that impact user experience, conversion, or business goals
- **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Always read project-purpose-and-deliverables.md to understand the ultimate goal

## Instructions for Starting New Tasks
1. **Classify task complexity** (S/M/L based on CLAUDE.md guidelines)
