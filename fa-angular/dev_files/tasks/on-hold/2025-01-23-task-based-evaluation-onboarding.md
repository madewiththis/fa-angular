# Task: Task-Based Evaluation Onboarding System
**Date**: 2025-01-23 | **Complexity**: L | **Status**: research
**Component**: Complete onboarding system redesign with activation-focused task completion

## Problem Statement
**Core Issue**: Current onboarding has low engagement and activation rates because it teaches product features rather than helping users evaluate if FlowAccount solves their specific business needs.

**Solution Philosophy Shift**: 
- FROM: "Here's how to use our product" 
- TO: "Let's help you evaluate if this fits your needs through real task completion"

**Activation Goal**: Users create actual documents (quotes, invoices, reminders, etc.) during onboarding, experiencing real value and increasing paid plan conversion.

## Final Specifications (Agreed 2025-01-23)

### Terminology Consensus âœ…
- **Goals**: High-level business outcomes users want to achieve (e.g., "Improve Cash Flow")
- **Workflows**: How FlowAccount helps achieve those goals (e.g., "Quotation Follow-Up Process")
- **Tasks**: Specific sequential steps within each workflow (e.g., "Send follow-up reminder")

### System Architecture âœ…
**Goal â†’ Multiple Workflows â†’ Defined Outcomes Structure**

Each Goal has multiple Workflows, each Workflow has defined outcomes that contribute to the Goal:
- Example: Cash Flow Goal = Follow-up Workflow + Expense Management Workflow
- Each workflow has specific benefits that combine to achieve the parent goal
- Users can complete one workflow or multiple workflows per goal

### Complete Data Structure âœ…

```typescript
interface BusinessGoal {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  applicableRoles: UserRole[];
  applicableBusinessTypes: BusinessType[];
  workflows: GoalWorkflow[];
  overallBenefit: string; // Combined benefit of all workflows
  estimatedTotalTime: number; // Total minutes for all workflows
  successMetrics: string[]; // How to measure goal achievement
}

interface GoalWorkflow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  definedOutcome: string; // What this specific workflow achieves
  benefitStatement: string; // Specific measurable benefit
  tasks: WorkflowTask[];
  estimatedTime: number;
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  prerequisites?: string[]; // Other workflows that should be completed first
  completionCriteria: string; // How to know the workflow is successfully completed
}

interface WorkflowTask {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  
  // Learning Materials
  instructions: TaskInstructions;
  videoExample?: TaskVideo;
  interactiveDemo?: TaskDemo;
  
  // Completion Tracking
  taskOutcome: string; // What user will achieve by completing this task
  completionValidation: TaskValidation;
  estimatedTime: number; // Minutes to complete
  
  // User Experience
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  tips?: string[]; // Helpful hints for users
  commonMistakes?: string[]; // What to avoid
  
  // Technical Integration
  automationSupport?: PuppeteerAction; // For guided walkthroughs (Phase 4)
  requiredPermissions?: string[]; // What access user needs
  dependencies?: string[]; // Other tasks that must be completed first
}

// Additional interfaces for TaskInstructions, TaskVideo, TaskDemo, etc.
// (See conversation history for complete interface definitions)
```

### Personalization Methods âœ…
1. **Curated**: Role + Business Type â†’ predefined goal and workflow sequences
2. **Survey-Driven**: Survey answers map to goal attributes â†’ personalized recommendations
3. **Voice Input**: (Future - Phase 4) AI transcription â†’ intelligent recommendations

## Example Implementation

### Sample Business Goal: Improve Cash Flow

**Goal Definition**:
- **Name**: "Improve Cash Flow"
- **Description**: "Increase revenue collection speed and reduce unnecessary expenses"
- **Overall Benefit**: "Typically improve monthly cash position by 20-25% through better quote conversion and expense control"
- **Success Metrics**: ["Quote acceptance rate increase", "Average payment collection time reduction", "Monthly expense variance reduction"]

**Workflow 1: Quotation Follow-Up Process**
- **Defined Outcome**: "Increase quote acceptance rate and reduce sales cycle time"
- **Benefit Statement**: "Convert 30% more quotes into sales and reduce average sales cycle by 1 week"
- **Tasks**: ["Review pending quotations", "Send follow-up reminder", "Track response rates"]

**Workflow 2: Expense Management & Budget Control**
- **Defined Outcome**: "Reduce unnecessary spending and improve expense visibility"
- **Benefit Statement**: "Identify cost-saving opportunities worth 10-15% of monthly expenses and prevent budget overruns"
- **Tasks**: ["Set up expense categories", "Enable receipt scanning", "Create budget alerts", "Review expense reports"]

**Combined Goal Achievement**: "By mastering both workflows, you'll improve your cash flow through increased revenue (better quote conversion) and reduced costs (expense control) - typically resulting in 20-25% better monthly cash position."

### Additional Goal Examples by Persona

**Business Owners**: Improve Cash Flow, Reduce Administrative Burden, Make Data-Driven Decisions, Expand Business Operations

**Internal Accountants**: Ensure Tax Compliance, Maintain Financial Accuracy, Streamline Month-End Closing

**Administrators/Managers**: Improve Team Productivity, Standardize Business Processes

**Accounting Firms**: Scale Client Operations, Deliver Professional Reports

## Survey Integration Strategy

### Goal Selection Approach
**Survey Question**: "Which business goals are most important to you right now?" (select multiple)

**Role-Based Goal Suggestions**:
- **Business Owner** sees: Cash flow, growth, efficiency goals
- **Accountant** sees: Compliance, accuracy, reporting goals  
- **Administrator** sees: Team productivity, process standardization
- **Accounting Firm** sees: Client scaling, professional service delivery

**Business Type Refinement**:
- **Service Business**: Focus on time tracking, project billing, client management
- **Product Business**: Emphasize inventory, multi-channel sales, cost tracking
- **Mixed Business**: Balanced approach with both service and product workflows

### User Experience Flow
1. User selects business goals from curated list
2. For each selected goal: "Here are the workflows we recommend..."
3. User sees: Goal â†’ Multiple Workflows â†’ Expected Outcome for each
4. User can choose: "I want to try Workflow 1 first" or "Show me both workflows"
5. After completing Workflow 1: "âœ… Great! You've achieved [specific outcome]. Ready to try Workflow 2?"
6. After completing all workflows for a goal: "ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You've now experienced how FlowAccount helps you [achieve specific goal]"
