# Task: Personalized Onboarding Experience with Survey-Driven Recommendations
**Date**: 2025-01-22 | **Complexity**: L | **Status**: paused
**Component**: Dashboard Get Started onboarding system with User Profile Testing integration

## Problem Statement
Built a **personalized onboarding experience** that:
1. **Surveys users** about their testing goals and feature needs
2. **Leverages signup data** (role, business type) for intelligent personalization
3. **Integrates with User Profile Testing system** for development/testing scenarios
4. **Generates personalized tutorial recommendations** based on combined data
5. **Provides targeted guidance** rather than generic onboarding for all users

**Key Innovation**: Survey-driven personalization combined with signup data ensures users see tutorials relevant to their specific use case and role (e.g., Owner + Service Business â†’ specific tutorial recommendations).

## Research & Analysis
### Codebase Investigation - COMPLETED
- **Enhanced get-started component**: `/src/app/pages/dashboard/get-started/get-started.component.ts`
  - Now orchestrates between profile preview and survey components
  - Smart flow logic based on available profile data
  - Integration with User Profile Testing Service
- **Signup integration**: `/src/app/pages/landing/signup/signup.ts`
  - Enhanced with business type and role questions
  - Automatic data flow to User Profile Testing Service
  - Cookie-based data persistence for development testing
- **User Profile Testing System**: `/src/app/services/user-profile-testing.service.ts`
  - Extended to include signup fields (email, names, company, role, business_type)
  - Cookie-based state management with 30-day persistence
  - Modal interface for testing different user scenarios

### Architecture Decisions - IMPLEMENTED
- **Survey-driven personalization**: OnboardingSurveyComponent with 3-question flow
- **Profile-aware flow**: Shows user their signup data with edit capabilities
- **Testing integration**: Seamless integration with User Profile Testing for development
- **Cookie-based persistence**: All state preserved across sessions
- **Minimalist UI**: White buttons with black borders for rapid experimentation
