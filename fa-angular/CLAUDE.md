## Development Guidelines

### Prototyping Philosophy
- **Frontend-Only**: No backend integration required
- **Production Feel**: Code quality that feels like production
- **Rapid Iteration**: Easy to modify branding, copy, and layouts
- **Stakeholder Ready**: Polished enough for client presentations

### Component Architecture
- **Standalone Components**: All components use standalone: true for modularity
- **Self-Contained Features**: Each feature is designed to be as standalone as possible to facilitate easy adoption and integration into the production site
- **Reactive Patterns**: RxJS for state management
- **TypeScript Strict**: Full type safety enforced
- **SCSS Modules**: Component-scoped styling with minimal dependencies
- **Design System**: Consistent patterns for new FlowAccount brand
- **Minimal Coupling**: Components designed for easy extraction to production codebase

### Code Conventions
- **Path Aliases**: Use `@components/*` for component imports
- **Service Injection**: Use `inject()` function for dependency injection
- **Interfaces**: Define TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Template/Style**: Separate HTML and SCSS files for components
- **Copy Management**: Sales copy and content easily modifiable for testing
- **Angular Templates**: Use `&#64;` HTML entity for @ symbols in templates (Angular 17+ interprets `@` as control flow blocks like `@if`, `@for`)

### Media Player Usage
```typescript
// Launch floating player
this.mediaPlayerService.launchFloatingPlayer({
  id: 'unique-video-id',
  url: 'path/to/video.mp4',
  title: 'Video Title',
  description: 'Video description'
});

// Launch fixed player
this.mediaPlayerService.launchFixedPlayer(config);

// Listen to state changes
this.mediaPlayerService.state$.subscribe(state => {
  // Handle state updates
});
```

## Git Repository & Collaboration

### Repository Management
This project is managed as a Git repository to enable:
- **Version Control**: Track changes to design iterations and feature updates
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple team members can contribute to the prototype
- **Branch Management**: Feature branches for testing different design approaches
- **Change History**: Complete audit trail of prototype evolution

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Clone the private repository
git clone https://github.com/madewiththis/fa-angular.git

# Create feature branch for new designs
git checkout -b feature/new-hero-design

# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update hero section with new branding"

# Push changes for team review
git push origin feature/new-hero-design
```

### Repository Details
- **URL**: https://github.com/madewiththis/fa-angular
- **Access**: Private repository (team members need access permissions)
- **Organization**: madewiththis
- **Hosting**: GitHub with Vercel integration for automatic deployments

### Team Access & Review
The prototype is hosted at **flowaccount.vercel.com** to provide access to the wider FlowAccount teams to:
- **Review**: Examine new features and UI designs in a production-like environment
- **Comment**: Provide feedback on design decisions and user experience flows
- **Understand Behavior**: See how updated features and UI should behave in the actual application

## Security Considerations

### Demo Environment
- Hardcoded password for demo access (not production-ready)
- Session timeout for security
- Route guards for protected areas

### Best Practices
- No sensitive data in localStorage
- Proper TypeScript typing for security
- Angular's built-in XSS protection

## Performance Optimizations

### Lazy Loading
- Route-based code splitting with `loadComponent()`
- Reduced initial bundle size

### Bundle Management
- Video.js dependencies properly configured
- Bundle size monitoring with budgets
- Tree-shaking enabled

### Media Player Optimizations
- Position persistence reduces re-watching
- Efficient state management with RxJS
- Memory cleanup on component destruction

## ðŸŽ¯ AI-Optimized Task Management System

**A complexity-based approach designed for zero-context resumability and AI collaboration.**

### Task Classification by Complexity

**Simple Tasks (S)**
- Single file changes, config updates, typos, styling fixes
- **Scope**: Isolated changes with minimal dependencies
- **Documentation**: TodoWrite tool only, no file creation needed

**Standard Tasks (M)**  
- Feature enhancements, new components, API endpoints, multi-file changes
- **Scope**: Well-defined changes with clear boundaries
- **Documentation**: Brief task file with clear context for resumption

**Complex Tasks (L)**
- New features, architectural changes, cross-system integrations
- **Scope**: Multiple components, potential breaking changes, research required
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive task file with decision logs and architecture notes

### Universal Task Flow

#### 1. Problem Understanding & Classification
- **Clarify the problem** and desired outcome with user
- **Classify complexity** (S/M/L) based on scope and dependencies
- **Confirm alignment** and document task appropriately

#### 2. Zero-Context Documentation Strategy

**For Simple Tasks (S):**
- Use TodoWrite tool only with descriptive task description
- Include file paths and specific changes needed

**For Standard Tasks (M):**
- Create task file: `/dev_files/tasks/active/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{brief-name}.md`
- Include enough context that a fresh AI instance can immediately understand and continue

**For Complex Tasks (L):**
- Create comprehensive task file with decision logs and research findings
- Document "AI handoff points" - everything needed to continue work

#### 3. AI-Resumable Implementation

**Status Progression:**
- `todo` - Task defined, not started
- `research` - Understanding current state and approach  
- `in_progress` - Active implementation
- `testing` - Verification phase
- `blocked` - Waiting for user input or external dependency
- `awaiting_user_approval` - Implementation complete, pending explicit user (project owner) quality/UX check
- `completed` - Only mark as completed after the user has explicitly approved the result
- `abandoned` - Stopped with documented reason

**MANDATORY USER APPROVAL:**
- Every task must include a step for explicit user (project owner) quality and UX check.
- The task is only marked as `completed` after the user has reviewed and explicitly stated that it passes their standards.
- Until then, the task remains in `awaiting_user_approval` status.

**AI Handoff Requirements:**
- Current understanding of the problem
- Files already examined/modified
- Key architectural decisions made
- Next specific steps to take
- Any blockers or dependencies discovered

### AI-Scannable File Organization

**Task management is located in the root directory:**
```
/dev_files/tasks/
â”œâ”€â”€ _task_index.md             # AI-readable task overview and status (START HERE)
â”œâ”€â”€ active/                    # Currently in progress
â”œâ”€â”€ completed/                 # Finished tasks (reference)
â””â”€â”€ abandoned/                 # Stopped tasks with lessons
```

**ðŸš€ IMPORTANT FOR AI INSTANCES**: Always start by reading `/dev_files/tasks/_task_index.md` to understand current project state and active tasks.

### Task Templates for AI Resumability

- **2025-01-16-routing-config.md** (S) - Route guard configuration

## Abandoned (Learn from failures)  
- **2025-01-15-complex-animation.md** (L) - Advanced hero animations
  - REASON: Too complex without performance impact analysis

## Quick Context for AI
**How to use this system:**
1. Scan this index to understand current state
2. Read the specific task file for detailed context  
3. Ask user which task to work on or continue
4. Update task file with progress and decisions
5. Update this index when status changes

**Project Patterns:**
- Components: Angular standalone components in `/src/app/components/`
- Services: Business logic in `/src/app/services/`
- Routing: Angular Router with lazy loading
- Styling: SCSS with Angular Material theming
- Testing: Jasmine/Karma co-located with components
```

### AI Workflow Integration

**Fresh Instance Onboarding:**
1. **ALWAYS START**: Read `/dev_files/tasks/_task_index.md` for immediate context
2. **Task Selection**: Ask user: "I see {X} active tasks. Which would you like me to work on?"
3. **Get Context**: Read specific task file in `/dev_files/tasks/active/` for detailed context
4. **Sync Status**: Update TodoWrite with current understanding
5. **Work & Update**: Proceed with implementation, updating task file with progress

**TodoWrite Integration:**
- Sync TodoWrite with task file status 
- Use TodoWrite for real-time progress within a session
- Update task file at completion or when blocked

**Git Integration:**
- Branch naming: `task/{date}-{brief-name}` (e.g., `task/2025-01-17-hero-fixes`)
- Commit messages reference task: `feat: implement hero responsive design (ref: 2025-01-17-component-updates.md)`
- Move task to completed/ folder after successful merge

**Quality Gates by Complexity:**
- **S**: Manual verification, basic testing
- **M**: Component testing + linting + type checking
- **L**: Full test suite + integration tests + performance verification

### System Benefits for AI Collaboration

1. **Zero Context Resumability**: Any AI can pick up any task immediately
2. **Complexity-Appropriate**: Simple fixes don't get buried in documentation  
3. **Decision Preservation**: Architecture choices and reasoning captured
4. **Progress Transparency**: Users can see exactly where things stand
5. **Learning System**: Completed tasks become reference patterns
6. **Failure Analysis**: Abandoned tasks document what didn't work and why

**Key Innovation**: The `_task_index.md` file serves as an **AI dashboard** - scan once to understand the entire project state, then dive deep into specific tasks as needed.
