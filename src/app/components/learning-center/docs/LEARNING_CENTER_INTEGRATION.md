# Learning Center Integration with Get Started Dashboard

> **ðŸ“š Documentation Navigation**: [README](README.md) | [Overview](OVERVIEW.md) | [Panel Docs](PANEL_DOCUMENTATION.md) | [Panel Integration](PANEL_CONTENT_INTEGRATION.md) | [API Reference](API_REFERENCE.md) | [Integration Guide](INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) | [UI Wireframe](UI_WIREFRAME.md) | **Dashboard Integration**

## Overview

The FlowAccount Get Started dashboard integrates with the Learning Center system to provide dynamic, curated learning content. This allows admins to manage what learning experiences appear on the Get Started page through the Learning Center admin interface. This is one example of how the Learning Center content management system can be integrated throughout the application.

> **ðŸŽ¯ Complete Integration Examples**: See [Integration Guide](INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for additional integration patterns, including the Learning Center Panel interface.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Flow
```
Learning Center Admin â†’ Quick Guide Categories â†’ Get Started Dashboard
```

1. **Learning Center Admin**: Create and manage Tasks, Workflows, and Goals
2. **Quick Guide Categories**: Curate collections of learning content for specific topics
3. **Get Started Dashboard**: Dynamically displays categories and their assigned content

### 2. Quick Guide Categories
Located in the Learning Center admin under the "Get Started" tab, these categories allow you to:

- **Create themed learning collections** (e.g., "Dashboard Basics", "Sales Essentials")
- **Assign multiple content types** to each category:
  - Learning Tasks (step-by-step guides)
  - Learning Workflows (process sequences)
  - Learning Goals (comprehensive objectives)
- **Control visibility** with draft/published status
- **Set display order** and visual styling

### 3. Dashboard Integration
The Get Started dashboard automatically:

- **Pulls published categories** from the Learning Center
- **Transforms them into quick actions** with consistent UI
- **Generates sub-actions** from assigned tasks, workflows, and goals
- **Provides completion tracking** (TODO: implement progress tracking)

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- **Dynamic category loading** from Learning Center
- **Automatic UI transformation** to match existing Get Started design
- **Sub-action generation** from assigned learning content
- **Icon mapping** and visual consistency
- **Sample content population** for testing

### ðŸš§ TODO Features
- **Progress tracking** for tasks, workflows, and goals
- **Completion state persistence** across sessions
- **Learning panel integration** for guided experiences
- **User role-based content filtering**
- **Analytics tracking** for learning engagement

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators

1. **Access Learning Center Admin**
   - Navigate to the admin interface
   - Go to the "Get Started" tab

2. **Create Quick Guide Categories**
   ```typescript
   // Example category structure
   {
     name: "Sales Essentials",
     subtitle: "Master the core selling features", 
     description: "Create quotations, billing notes, and tax invoices",
     icon: "point_of_sale",
     order: 2,
     status: "published",
     featureMapping: "sell"
   }
   ```

3. **Assign Learning Content**
   - Add relevant tasks, workflows, and goals to each category
   - Use the assignment interface to select from published content
   - Preview changes on the Get Started page

4. **Test Integration**
   - Use the "Populate Sample Content" button on Get Started page
   - Verify categories appear with assigned content
   - Test sub-action execution

### For Developers

#### Key Integration Points

**GetStartedComponent Integration:**
```typescript
// Learning Center service injection
private learningContentService = inject(LearningContentService);

// Reactive data access
readonly quickGuideCategories = this.learningContentService.quickGuideCategories;
readonly learningTasks = this.learningContentService.tasks;
readonly learningWorkflows = this.learningContentService.workflows;
readonly learningGoals = this.learningContentService.goals;

// Transform categories to quick actions
quickActions = computed(() => {
  const publishedCategories = this.quickGuideCategories()
    .filter(qg => qg.status === 'published');
  
  return publishedCategories.map(category => 
    this.transformCategoryToAction(category, setupCompleted)
  );
});
```

**Category Transformation:**
```typescript
transformCategoryToAction(category: QuickGuideCategory, setupCompleted: boolean) {
  return {
    id: category.id,
    title: category.name,
    description: category.subtitle,
    icon: category.icon,
    iconClass: this.getIconClassForCategory(category),
    completed: this.isCategoryCompleted(category),
    enabled: setupCompleted,
    subActions: this.getSubActionsForCategory(category),
    action: () => this.selectQuickAction(category.id)
  };
}
```

#### Data Structure

**Quick Guide Category:**
```typescript
interface QuickGuideCategory {
  id: string;
  name: string;           // Display title
  subtitle: string;       // Short description
  description: string;    // Full description
  icon: string;          // Material icon name
  order: number;         // Display order
  status: ContentStatus; // draft | published | archived
  featureMapping?: string; // Maps to FlowAccount feature
  assignedTaskIds: string[];
  assignedWorkflowIds: string[];
  assignedGoalIds: string[];
  version: number;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```
